Abstract Declarative Application Language -- Scala DSL implementation


The language considered to create abstract definitions of comprehensive applications. Abstract definition of an application then translates to native code of a target platform or several platforms. When the application runs on the target platform a predefined Core-framework supports declared behavior in run-time period.
To declare internal structure of the application intended to use Dataflows between Containers which manage lifecycle of Components. A component could be a receiver of information from or a sender of information to a dataflow or implement both roles. A dataflow constitutes by its data structure and a supporting lifecycle. Dataflows are immutable and uni-directional, to organize bi-directional relation between two containers two dataflows should be created.
Being abstract the language decouples an application structure from all business logic and intended to declare very abstract relations between Containers & Components in terms of data interactions.
